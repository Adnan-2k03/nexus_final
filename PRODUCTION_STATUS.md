**Project:** Nexus - Real-time Player Finding MVP Platform

## Current Status

🔴 **Production Environment Temporarily Unavailable**

The live deployment at `https://nexus-final-tau.vercel.app/` is currently **temporarily offline** while we're integrating Android app capabilities using Capacitor.

## What Happened

We are actively developing an **Android mobile version** of Nexus using Capacitor (a cross-platform framework that bridges web apps to native mobile platforms). During this integration process, we encountered compatibility issues that temporarily took the production environment offline.

- **Expected Resolution:** September 30th, 8:00 AM
